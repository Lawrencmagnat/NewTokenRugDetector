## 🧩 Overview  

**NewToken Rug Detector** is a **Drosera-compatible smart contract** that helps detect potential rug pulls for newly launched tokens on UniswapV2-style DEX pairs.  

It works by monitoring the liquidity of a specific pair and flags any large, suspicious liquidity drops that occur within a short time window — an early warning system for “new-token rugs.”

This repository also includes a **ResponseProtocol deployment script** and a **Drosera configuration (.toml)** for easy integration and automation.

## ⚙️ Smart Contracts  

### 💣 NewTokenRugDetector.sol  

#### 🧠 Purpose  
Detect early-stage rug pulls by analyzing the liquidity behavior of a UniswapV2-compatible pair.  

It identifies a rug when liquidity drops sharply (≥ 50% by default) within a short time window (≤ 500 blocks).  

---

### 🔑 Key Constants  

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PAIR` | Address of the UniswapV2-style liquidity pair being monitored |
| `THRESHOLD_BPS` | Liquidity drop threshold in basis points (default: 5000 = 50%) |
| `LAUNCH_WINDOW_BLOCKS` | Max block window where a large drop is considered a rug (default: 500) |

---

### ⚡ Main Functions  

#### `collect()`  
Safely fetches the total liquidity and current block number from the Uniswap pair.  
Returns encoded `(totalLiquidity, blockNumber)` values.  
If the pair doesn’t exist or has no code, it safely returns zero liquidity.  

#### `shouldRespond()`  
Analyzes multiple data points to detect large liquidity drops within the defined block range.  
If the drop meets or exceeds the threshold, the function triggers a response flag.  

**Trigger condition:**  
```

Liquidity drop ≥ THRESHOLD_BPS
AND
(latestBlock - oldestBlock) ≤ LAUNCH_WINDOW_BLOCKS

## 🚀 DeployResponseProtocol Script  

The `DeployResponseProtocol.s.sol` script deploys the **ResponseProtocol** contract to your target network using Foundry.

```solidity
contract DeployResponseProtocol is Script, Test {
    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        ResponseProtocol _responseProtocol = new ResponseProtocol();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
````

### ▶️ Deployment Command

```bash
forge script script/DeployResponseProtocol.s.sol \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --broadcast
```

## 🧭 Drosera Integration

The provided **drosera.toml** file allows seamless integration with the Drosera relay system.

### Example Configuration

```toml
ethereum_rpc = "https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com/"
drosera_rpc = "https://relay.hoodi.drosera.io/"
eth_chain_id = 560048
drosera_address = "0x91cB447BaFc6e0EA0F4Fe056F5a9b1F14bb06e5D"

[traps]

[traps.new_token_rug_detector]
path = "out/NewTokenRugDetector.sol/NewTokenRugDetector.json"
response_contract = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
response_function = ""
cooldown_period_blocks = 50
min_number_of_operators = 1
max_number_of_operators = 3
block_sample_size = 8
private_trap = true
whitelist = ["0xF5b50349E7Dc2be6d8E5ae7293CBE1DB63589cD9"]
```

## 🛠 Setup & Deployment Guide

### 1️⃣ Install Foundry

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/newtoken-rug-detector.git
cd newtoken-rug-detector
```

### 3️⃣ Build Contracts

```bash
forge build
```

### 4️⃣ Deploy ResponseProtocol

```bash
forge script script/DeployResponseProtocol.s.sol \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --broadcast
```

### 5️⃣ Deploy Rug Detector

Deploy `NewTokenRugDetector.sol` either via Foundry or Remix,
then update the deployed contract address in your `drosera.toml` file.

### 6️⃣ Connect to Drosera

Start the Drosera relay or CLI and watch for rug detection responses.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Drosera Relay** periodically calls `collect()` on the trap contract.
2. The liquidity and block data are stored as samples.
3. `shouldRespond()` compares recent samples for liquidity drops.
4. If the drop exceeds the set threshold, Drosera triggers a response action (alert/report).
5. This system enables decentralized, on-chain rug pull detection for new tokens.
